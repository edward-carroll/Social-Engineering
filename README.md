Social Engineering: What it is and What to look out for

What is Social Engineering 

  Social engineering is the act of manipulating, tricking, or deceiving people into giving up confidential information or performing actions that compromise security.         Unlike technical hacking, it targets human psychology rather than software or systems.

  It’s about exploiting trust, urgency, fear, or curiosity to bypass security procedures.

  Example: thief who wears a delivery uniform to sneak into a secure building — they don’t hack the system; they manipulate people into letting them in.

Why it Works

Humans are the weakest link in cybersecurity. Social engineers:

  Exploit emotions (fear, urgency, curiosity, empathy)

  Rely on authority (“I’m from IT”)

  Create false trust (“I’m your coworker’s friend”)

  Take advantage of gaps in awareness or training

Common Types of Social Engineering 

1. Phishing

  Fraudulent emails or texts pretending to be from trusted sources to steal info or install malware.

  Example: “Your bank account is locked. Click here to unlock it.”


2. Spear Phishing

  Targeted phishing aimed at specific individuals, often using personal information to appear legitimate.

  Example: “Hi Edward, here’s the document from your last meeting — let me know what you think.”


3. Vishing (Voice Phishing)

  Scammers call pretending to be from your bank, tech support, or the IRS.

  Example: “We’ve detected suspicious activity — can you verify your SSN?”


4. Smishing (SMS Phishing)
  Fraudulent messages sent via text, often with malicious links.

  Example: “Package delivery failed. Update your info here.”


5. Pretexting

  Creating a fabricated scenario to gain access to information or systems.

  Example: “I’m your IT technician doing a system audit — can you give me your login?”


6. Baiting

  Offering something enticing (like a free USB drive or free download) that actually contains malware.


7. Tailgating / Piggybacking

  An unauthorized person physically follows someone into a restricted area by pretending to belong.

Warning Signs of Social Engineering 

  Unsolicited messages requesting login credentials or personal info

  High urgency: “Act now or your account will be closed!”

  Too good to be true: “You’ve won a prize!”

  Requests for secrecy: “Don’t tell anyone, this is confidential.”
  
  Unexpected attachments or links

  Caller ID spoofing (appears legitimate but is fake)

Common Ways to Protect Aganist Social Engineering 

Verify the Source	- Contact the person/company directly through official channels

Be Skeptical - Don’t trust unsolicited emails, calls, or messages

Slow Down	- Social engineers use urgency — take time to think

Hover Over Links - Check URLs before clicking (look for misspellings or odd domains)

Don’t Share Sensitive Info - Never give out passwords, SSNs, or codes over phone/email

Report Suspicious Activity - Notify IT or security teams immediately

Use Multi-Factor Authentication	- Adds a second layer of defense even if credentials are stolen
